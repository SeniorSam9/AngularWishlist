<!--
  - "*" sign is a directive

  - ngFor | ngIf are structural directive (changes the DOM content)
    directive value is a js code

  - using [] is data binding, like [checked]="item.isCompleted"
    [attr.data-index]="i" binding index to input 
    (for loop on input so we need to know which one is checked)
  
  - using () is event binding

  - [(ngModel)] is used to bind form data to angular FormsModule
    it is put as an attribute on the input element
